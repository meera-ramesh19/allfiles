MEGA SUMMER Daily Standup 03


CHALLENGE
Sum Mixed Array
https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eaeb9578748ff92a000009
PREP
Parameters
An array of integers as strings and numbers (e.g.) [9, “9”]
Positive, whole numbers only
Returns
The sum (as an integer) of the array values, as if all were integers.
Examples / Tests
console.log(sumMix([9, 3, '7', '3']), 22);
console.log(sumMix(['5', '0', 9, 3, 2, 1, '9', 6, 7]), 42); 
console.log(sumMix(['3', 6, 6, 0, '5', 8, 5, '6', 2,'0']), 41); 

Pseudocode

.map() to loop through each element in the array
.reduce() takes in accumulator, current value
Number(n) creates a new Number value, we want to change the current value to a Number



Solution

function sumMix(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((a, c) => a + Number(c), 0)
}


NOTES
.Why is the 0 important? because it catches a possible empty array and makes sure the answer is zero rather than undefined.


ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
Map MDN
Reduce MDN
Number MDN When used as a function, Number(value) converts a string or other value to the Number type. If the value can't be converted, it returns NaN.
WHAT DO I NEED TO REVIEW?  WHERE DID I GET STUCK?
