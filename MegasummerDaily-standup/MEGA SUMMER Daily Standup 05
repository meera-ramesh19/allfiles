CHALLENGE
Remove Consecutive Duplicate Words
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b39e91ee7a2c103300018b3
Your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate words from a string, leaving only first word entries.
PREP
Parameters
A string of various repeating words.  No punctuation, no gotchas.
Returns
The original string, containing only the first instance of each word that repeats. So like, “aaa bbb ccc dd aaaa ccc ddd” -> “a b c d a c d” (just the first of each repeat).
Examples / Tests
"alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta" --> "alpha beta gamma delta alpha beta gamma delta"  


Pseudocode

Need to .split() the string into an array
Need to .filter() through the array with a condition - if the string repeats, do not add the repeat to the accumulator.
Condition: If the element does not equal the last element in the array (i-1), join.



Solution

const removeConsecutiveDuplicates = s => s.split(" ").filter((e, i, arr) => e != arr[i - 1]).join(" ");


NOTES
Don’t forget the space between the quotes in .split(“ “) and .join(“ “)
