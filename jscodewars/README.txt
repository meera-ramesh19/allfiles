Hi,

Thank you so much for purchasing the AlgoDaily Book. I'm thrilled you thought enough of our content to support us financially, and it's a great joy to be able to share knowledge with all of our students and visitors.

As promised, attached are the PDF, Mobi, and ePub versions of the AlgoDaily Book: Core Essentials. You'll find the 800+ page book to be full of new and legacy AlgoDaily lessons and challenges, beautifully designed to deliver a great reading experience.

I hope you'll find the book to be amazingly helpful in your journey to land a job in the great software engineering industry. When I got my first software engineer job, it changed my life in ways better than I could've ever imagined. For those who are already in the industry, keep on rocking. For those trying to break in, I hope this material accelerates your growth and helps to achieve your goals.

Best of luck,
Jake
